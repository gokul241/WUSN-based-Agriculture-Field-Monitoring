# WUSN-based-Agriculture-Field-Monitoring
This project monitors the Agriculture Field Parameters using Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSN) and the data is also monitored online through IoT.

## Overview
Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) is a specialized kind of WSNs where some of the nodes are deployed below the ground, either in soil or in a similar confined environment. This mainly focuses on the use of sensors at the subsurface region of the soil. It is envisioned to provide real time monitoring capabilities in the underground soil environment.

In a WUSN-based agriculture field monitoring system, sensor nodes are strategically deployed beneath the soil surface to continuously monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, pH levels, nutrient content (Nitogen, Phosphorous, Pottasium ). These nodes communicate wirelessly with each other and with a central control system, forming a robust network that covers the entire agricultural area.

The integration of IoT technology further enhances the capabilities of WUSNs by enabling seamless connectivity and data exchange between sensor nodes, edge devices, and cloud-based platforms. Through IoT-enabled devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, farmers can remotely access real-time data and receive alerts or notifications about critical changes in soil or crop conditions.
